- Unit tests
- Containerized app (Docker)

## Evaluation criteria:

- Creativity: The previous instructions do not limit any desire of the developer, be free
- Organization: project structure, versioning
- Good practices, Standards (Code Guide Style, Linters, etc)
- Technology: use of paradigms, frameworks and libraries
